We don't have an officially supported .NET library, but Robert at [http://USGovXML.com](http://USGovXML.com) has been kind enough to share a working sample SMART ASP.NET app, packaged in a VS2008 Project. The app

    Serves bootstrap.html and index.html on port 8000
    Parses SMART REST tokens from the supplied cookie
    Issues an OAuth-signed REST call to get medications on the current patient record 

Download the project at [http://usgovxml.com/examples/Public/SMARTWebApp.zip](http://usgovxml.com/examples/Public/SMARTWebApp.zip)
